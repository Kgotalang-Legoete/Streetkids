          <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: arial;"> Street children are poor or homeless children who live on the streets of a city, town, or village.<br>
             Homeless youth are often called street kids, or urchins.Some street children, notably in more developed nations,
             are part of a sub-category called thrown-away children, consisting of children who have been forced to leave home.<br> 
             Thrown-away children are more likely to come from single-parent homes. Street children are often subject to abuse, 
             neglect, exploitation, or, in extreme cases, murder by "clean-up squads" that have been hired by local businesses or police<br>
             In 1848, Lord Ashley referred to more than 30,000 "naked, filthy, roaming lawless, and deserted children" in and around London, UK.
             Among many English novels featuring them as a humanitarian problem are Jessica's First Prayer by Sarah Smith (1867) and Georgina Castle Smith's Nothing to Nobody (1872).
             By 1922, there were at least seven million homeless children in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic due to the devastation from World War I and the Russian Civil War, <br>see "Orphans in the Soviet Union".
             Abandoned children formed gangs, created their own argot, and engaged in petty theft and prostitution. </font>
